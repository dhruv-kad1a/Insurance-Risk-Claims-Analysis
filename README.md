# Insurance Risk & Claims Analysis
## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing insurance policies and claim patterns using Power BI. The goal is to help insurers gain deeper insights into customer demographics, vehicle details, and claim behaviors, enabling data-driven decision-making for risk management, pricing strategies, and fraud detection.

## Dataset
The dataset contains 37,541 records of policyholders, including:
- **Demographics:** Age, Gender, Education, Marital Status, Parent Status
- **Vehicle Details:** Car Make, Model, Year, Usage Type, Coverage Zone
- **Claims Data:** Claim Amount, Claim Frequency
- **Household Data:** Household Income, Kids Driving

**Key Business KPIs**
- Total Policies: 37,541
- Total Claim Amount: $187.8M
- Total Claims Filed: 19,158
- Average Claim Amount: $5,003
- Average Claims per Policy: 0.51

**Insights & Findings**
- Age Groups: Policyholders aged 40–60 contributed the highest claim impact ($71M, 38% of total claims).
- Car Usage: Private vehicles (80%) dominate policies, but commercial cars show higher risk per policy.
- Car Brands: Top 5 by claim amount → Ford ($16.6M), Chevrolet ($14.8M), Dodge ($9.3M), Toyota ($9.0M), GMC ($8.7M).
- Gender Split: Balanced distribution – 50.1% Female, 49.9% Male.
- Coverage Zones: Claims are slightly higher in urban areas compared to rural/suburban zones.
- Household Risks: Families with multiple young drivers show significantly higher claim frequency.
